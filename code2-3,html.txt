		<p> The <em> School of Athens</em>, considered by many to be Ralhael's 
		     masterwork, is a fresco representing the greatest minds of 
			 classical antiquity, gathered together to share their 
			 thoughts and beliefs. The fresco was painted between 1509 and 1511
			 as a part of a comission to decorate the rooms of the
			 Stanza di Raffello in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatician. </p>
		<p>The two center figures, Aristotle and Plato, are key philosophers 
           in the development of Western thought. Plato with his belief in a
           higher reality points skyward. Within his hands, Plato holds
           the <cite>Timasus </cite> &mdash: one of Plato's famous dialogs on
           the nature of reality and time. In contrast, Aristotle points 
           downward, indicating that he is grounded in a reality that can be 
           experienced by sight and touch. In his hands he holds his 
           book <cite>Ethics</cite>, a time that emphasizes the need for 
           justice, friendship and ethical government.

         <p> Othet famous philosophers fill the pseudo-architecture. In many cases, 
             When Raphael did not have classical images to draw upon. He used 
             images of contemporary figures to stand in for their classical 
             counterparts. Look for a portrait of Michaelangelo in the left forward 
             steps, his thoughts concerned with sketching and art.
